# instipy
ðŸ‘‹ Hello there,
This is basically a very basic project over automating Instagram with python 
The file uses <b>Selenium Framework</b> and <b>Firefox Webdriver</b>
Inside file I have created a list of user names of instagram whome I'll send the message
you can change the usernames and whatever the user name you will give it will automatically send 
message to them.
